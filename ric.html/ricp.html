            <h2> Step by step guide</h2> 
            <strong> Ingredients :</strong>
            <p>Chicken — Chicken drumsticks and thighs are ideal for this recipe, as these retain moisture during the slow cooking process, resulting in juicy and succulent chicken.  

                Rice — Extra long Basmati rice is the most preferred choice for making Chicken Biryani. When cooked, the grains stay separate and fluffy and absorb the flavors of the spices and chicken well. Look out for the properly aged fragrant basmati rice for best results.
                
                Ginger and Garlic paste — A fundamental component of most savory dishes, ginger and garlic infuse the dish with a depth of flavor. The zesty warmth of ginger combines with the spicy earthiness of the garlic, adding an aromatic richness to the marinade.Fresh herbs — Cilantro and mint are vital components of this Chicken biryani as they elevate the overall taste of the recipe. They add a burst of freshness to the dish and infuse a delightful fragrance while balancing the richness of spices and other ingredients.Onions — They are one of the significant ingredients of this Chicken Biryani, and a lot of them are used here. The crispy fried caramelized onions, called Birista, are the key components that are used for garnishing and adding a smokey sweetness to the dish. 

                Whole Spices — The hallmark of traditional biryani recipes, whole spices create an aromatic base that infuses into the entire dish, imparting a unique flavor profile. Bay leaves, whole black cardamom, star anise, cinnamon sticks, cloves, peppercorns, and shahi jeera are the significant spices rendering depth and complexity of flavors to the recipe. 
                
                Spices and seasonings — Creating a delectable balance of heat, earthiness, and sweetness, the spices and herbs elevate the deliciousness of the biryani. Degi mirch, coriander powder, turmeric, garam masala powder, mace, and salt are the essential spices and seasonings used to make this soul ravisher. Milk and Saffron — Saffron threads soaked in warm milk impart a vibrant yellow color to the dish besides the exquisite aroma. Saffron-infused milk enhances the overall taste and adds a subtle, luxurious flavor to the recipe. 

                Yogurt and Lime juice — Used in the marinade for their unique qualities, yogurt and lime juice are the essential ingredients of this recipe. Lime juice tenderizes the chicken while also adding citrusy notes to the dish. Yogurt also helps tenderize the chicken while rendering creamy richness to the marinade. 
                
                Ghee + Oil — Any neutral, refined oil is good for cooking the biryani. But homemade desi ghee will create wonders.  </p>

                <h3> <strong> How to cook :</strong></h3>
                <ol> <li>  Heat oil in a pan.  <img src="Heat-oil-in-a-pan.jpg.webp" alt="oil" height="50px" width="50px"> </li>
                    <li> Combine the thinly sliced onions and cornstarch in a large bowl. Toss to coat cornstarch all over the onion rings. <img src="biryani_1.jpg.webp" alt=" on"height="50px" width="50px"></li>
                    <li> Dust off the excess cornstarch and add a batch of onion rings to the hot shimmering oil. Fry the onions for 7-8 minutes or until deep golden brown. Remove from oil and drain on a kitchen paper towel. Repeat until all the coated onions are cooked. <img src="biryani_2.jpg.webp" alt=" on2"height="50px" width="50px"></li>
                    <li> Fried onions are ready for biryani. <img src="biryani_3.jpg.webp" alt="on3" height="50px" width="50px"></li>
                    <li> Let’s move on to the next step. Add milk to a microwave-safe bowl. Heat the milk for 40 seconds. Remove from the microwave and add saffron strands to the milk. Stir until combined and set aside. <img src="saffron.jpg.webp" alt="sa"height="50px" width="50px"></li>
                    <li>Clean and wash the chicken pieces thoroughly under tap water. Drain the water completely. <img src="How-to-make-the-best-Chicken-Biryani-028.jpg.webp" alt="bbb" height="50px" width="50px"></li> 
               <li>Combine the rinsed chicken pieces with lemon juice in a large whisking bowl. Toss to combine. Cover and refrigerate the chicken for at least 30 minutes.<img src="How-to-make-the-best-Chicken-Biryani-01.jpg.webp" alt="ss" height="50px" width="50px"></li>
               <li>After the rest time is over, add yogurt, biryani spice blend, and ginger-garlic paste to the chicken.  <img src="How-to-make-the-best-Chicken-Biryani-02.jpg.webp" alt="fas"height="50px" width="50px"></li>
               <li>Add fried onions, mustard oil, cilantro leaves, and mint leaves to the chicken.

               <li>Mix and toss the chicken to coat in tis marinade. Rub the marinade all over the pieces<img src="How-to-make-the-best-Chicken-Biryani-05.jpg.webp" alt="aaa"height="50px" width="50px"></li>
               <li>Cover and allow it to rest for an hour.<img src="How-to-make-the-best-Chicken-Biryani-06.jpg.webp" alt="bbb" height="50px" width="50px"></li>
               <li>While the chicken is marinating, let's work with the rice. Sort through the rice to remove all the pebbles and gritty things. Rinse and rub rice thoroughly until the water runs clear. Pre-soak the rice for 20 minutes. After that, drain and set it aside.
                Tip — This step is essential. Soaking the rice for enough time allows the rice to become stronger, and as such, the rice puffs up really well. A minimum of 20 minutes of soaking time is recommended to achieve the best results.
