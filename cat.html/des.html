    <h1> Dessert food </h1>
    <hr>
    <article> <strong> Desserts come in an incredible variety, each with its own unique flavors, textures, and cultural significance. Here are some different types:
<br>
        Baked Desserts : Cakes, cookies, and pies fall into this category. Think of a classic cheesecake, a rich chocolate cake, or buttery shortbread cookies.
        <br>
        Frozen Treats : Ice cream, gelato, sorbet, and frozen yogurt offer a refreshing way to end a meal.
        <br>
        Fruity Delights : Fresh fruit, fruit-based desserts like tarts and crumbles, or caramelized treats such as bananas foster.
        <br>
        Confections : Candies, fudge, and marshmallows—these little bites of sugar are pure joy.
        <br>
        Pastries : Croissants, éclairs, and baklava are indulgent treats made with layers of dough, often filled with cream, nuts, or chocolate.
        <br>
        Custards & Puddings : Silky crème brûlée, creamy flan, or a comforting bowl of rice pudding.</strong></article>
