        Seafood has been a staple in human diets for centuries, offering nutritional benefits, cultural significance, and endless culinary possibilities. From freshwater species to ocean delicacies, seafood plays an essential role in food traditions worldwide.
        
        Origins and History of Seafood Consumption
