    <h2 id="sss"> Garlic Butter Shrimp </h2>
    <article> 
        <b> How to make it :</b> 
        <p>This 25-minute recipe requires just four ingredients and one skillet. Cook the minced garlic and shrimp in butter until the shrimp are cooked through. Then, add the lemon juice. Seriously, that’s it.

            The main thing you’ll want to avoid is overcooking the shrimp. Shrimp are one of the fastest-cooking proteins, and they’ll be finished in a mere five minutes. That time goes by fast, so make sure you have all the ingredients prepped and ready to go. Perfectly cooked shrimp are juicy, but overcooked shrimp become tough and rubbery.</p>
    <b> ingredients :</b>
    <ul> 
        <li> Shrimp</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li> butter</li>
        <li>lemon</li>
    </ul>
    <br> <b>
        Instruction :
    </b>
    <ol>
         <li> Saute the shrimp
        </li>
         <li>In a large skillet, saute the shrimp and garlic in butter for about five minutes until the shrimp turn pink.</li>
         <li>Finish with lemon juice</li>
         <li>Add Parmesan cheese: Make the shrimp even richer with a little shredded Parmesan cheese.
            Include spice: Give the dish a spicy kick with crushed red pepper flakes or cayenne pepper. You can also make it into Cajun shrimp with some paprika, cayenne, nutmeg and thyme.</li>
         <li>Turn it into a pasta sauce: Add a little white wine or a splash of pasta cooking water to turn the butter-garlic mixture into a pasta sauce, similar to lemon-garlic shrimp pasta or shrimp tortellini.</li>

        <h2 id="ddd"> Chocolate mug cake</h2>
        <article>
            <b> How to make this cake ? </b>
            <p>It couldn’t be easier to make a homemade mug cake: Combine the dry ingredients in a microwave-safe mug, stir in the wet ingredients, then cook in the microwave until the cake is done in the middle. You’ll find the full, step-by-step recipe below with detailed instructions. </p>
        <b> Ingredients :</b>
<ul>
    <li> flour</li>
    <li> sugar</li>
    <li> baking soda</li>
    <li>Cocoa powder</li>
    <li> salt</li>
    <li> milk</li>
    <li> vanila</li>
    <li> Oil</li>
    <li> water</li>

</ul> <br>
<b> Instruction</b>
<ol>
    <li>To start, you’ll need at least a 12-ounce mug. I suggest spraying the mug with nonstick cooking spray or greasing it with some butter so the cake doesn’t stick.</li>
    <li>Then, you’ll whisk together the all-purpose flour, cocoa powder, granulated sugar, baking powder, and a tiny pinch of salt. Next, add the milk, oil, and vanilla extract and stir until just combined. </li>
    <li>Once you’ve mixed up the cake batter, you’ll pour it into your greased mug. At this point, you can add some chocolate chips for a chocolate chip mug cake. This step is optional, but I love them! 

    </li>
    <li> you’ll want to microwave the cake until the center is just set. Mine is usually perfect right at 1 minute and 15 seconds, but the cooking time will vary slightly depending on the mug you use and your microwave.</li>
    <li>also suggest keeping an eye on the mug cake as it’s cooking and stopping the microwave as soon as the center looks done. I’ve found that even an extra 15 seconds in the microwave can lead to a cake that’s really dry.</li>

            <h2> stir Fried Tofu & Veggies</h2>
            <article>
                <b> How to make it?</b>
                <p>This healthy tofu stir fry has all the makings for a fast and easy vegetarian dinner. You can make the sauce and prep the vegetables and tofu ahead of time so that when it’s dinner time, you can quickly get a meal on the table.</p>
            <b> Ingredients :</b>
            <ul> 
                <li>Firm tofu</li>
                <li>Vegetable oil</li>
                <li>Soy sauce</li>
                <li> Garlic</li>
                <li>Vegetables</li>
                <li>Vegetables</li>
                <li> onion</li>
                <li> salt, pepper</li>

            </ul>
            <b> Instruction :</b>
            <Ol>
                <li>Combine the soy sauce, vegetable broth, and honey to make the sauce.
                    Cut the tofu into half-inch cubes and then put them in a large bowl. Season with soy sauce and then coat in cornstarch
                    Cook the tofu for a few minutes without moving it in a nonstick skillet or wok and then repeat on the other sides.
                    Remove the tofu from the skillet and then cook your veggies until they are soft.
                    Add the garlic and ginger and cook for about 30 seconds.
                    Put the tofu and sauce in the pan and cook for a couple of minutes.</li>
                <li>You can use any vegetables you like. I used broccolini and bell pepper, but broccoli, carrots, or snap peas would also work.
                    Rather use meat? Swap the tofu for shrimp or diced chicken.
                    Make the stir fry vegan by swapping the honey for maple or brown sugar.
                    Make a spicy tofu stir fry by adding sriracha to the sauce.
                    Serve the stir fry by itself or with rice or soba noodles, or if you want to keep it low-carb, use cauliflower rice or zucchini noodles.</li>
